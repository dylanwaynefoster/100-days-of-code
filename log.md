# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a JFrame with constructor to play around with a nice UI.

**Thoughts:** I really suck at GitHub!!!

**Link to work:** I deleted the repository!!!

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to properly create a repository and push/pull to it from command line. I added BeerCalc...I will probably use bits and pieces of this and blend it with the UI...maybe make it a method with getters/setters.

**Thoughts**: Glad to get the GitHub problems somewhat under control...

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added labels, text fields, and buttons to UI. I didn't add in any event handlers -- yet...

**Thoughts**: Need to figure out BorderLayout vs. FlowLayout...I can't get new lines in FlowLayout. Everything is back-to-back

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much at all :-( ... I worked for over 2 hours and seriously jacked up my UI. I'm not uploading this to Github.

**Thoughts**: Need to search the web to figure out how other people manage layouts in Java...the built in stuff is really not very good...

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a webapp that autofills city, state, and county after zipcode is entered. I lauched this to github pages.

**Thoughts**: I'm actually pretty proud of it. I got the Google geocoding API to work and debugged that it needed to be HTTPS. I haven't used APIs successfully this quickly before. https://dylanwaynefoster.github.io/zipToCounty/

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added getters and setters to the main class. Commited methods to do the calculations.

**Thoughts**: I haven't called methods from a separate class in a while. I need to review. I got kind of frustrated; I've been snowed in and not really feeling it today. I did about 1 1/2 hours today for the AleCulator2 project. I worked a long time on the zipToCounty app yesterday...probably why I'm not feeling it today.

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Generally cleaned up. Added event handling, and successfully called methods from another class. It is now an actual functioning ABV calculator!

**Thoughts**: I'm getting better at knowing how/when to call methods just generally. The UI thing is beating me up. I need to figure out the Layout Managers...like really figure them out.

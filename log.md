# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a JFrame with constructor to play around with a nice UI.

**Thoughts:** I really suck at GitHub!!!

**Link to work:** I deleted the repository!!!

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to properly create a repository and push/pull to it from command line. I added BeerCalc...I will probably use bits and pieces of this and blend it with the UI...maybe make it a method with getters/setters.

**Thoughts**: Glad to get the GitHub problems somewhat under control...

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added labels, text fields, and buttons to UI. I didn't add in any event handlers -- yet...

**Thoughts**: Need to figure out BorderLayout vs. FlowLayout...I can't get new lines in FlowLayout. Everything is back-to-back

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much at all :-( ... I worked for over 2 hours and seriously jacked up my UI. I'm not uploading this to Github.

**Thoughts**: Need to search the web to figure out how other people manage layouts in Java...the built in stuff is really not very good...

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a webapp that autofills city, state, and county after zipcode is entered. I lauched this to github pages.

**Thoughts**: I'm actually pretty proud of it. I got the Google geocoding API to work and debugged that it needed to be HTTPS. I haven't used APIs successfully this quickly before. https://dylanwaynefoster.github.io/zipToCounty/

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added getters and setters to the main class. Commited methods to do the calculations.

**Thoughts**: I haven't called methods from a separate class in a while. I need to review. I got kind of frustrated; I've been snowed in and not really feeling it today. I did about 1 1/2 hours today for the AleCulator2 project. I worked a long time on the zipToCounty app yesterday...probably why I'm not feeling it today.

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Generally cleaned up. Added event handling, and successfully called methods from another class. It is now an actual functioning ABV calculator!

**Thoughts**: I'm getting better at knowing how/when to call methods just generally. The UI thing is beating me up. I need to figure out the Layout Managers...like really figure them out.

### Day 7: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Now using GridBagLayout on AleCulator2. It looks much better but still not quite what I want. Also, I added a Menu Bar with File and Other Calculations tab.

**Thoughts**: The UI is WAY better now and at least intuitive. It still isn't what I envisioned. I'm going to continue working on it. I added a Menu Bar with File menu that includes 'exit'...but I can't get it to fire. I need to work on that. Also, continue working on Layout Managers until I get that down.

### Day 8: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added Menu Items About, and Coming Soon to the menu bar. I added informational pop-ups for those two with JOption pane. Using Action Listeners for those and for the 'Exit' choice which I finally got to work. I need to ensure that I really understand what's going on with these, they are a little tricky.

**Thoughts**: Getting better at actually following the OO logic. Need to continue getting better in general and read other people's Java code.

### Day 9: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: None really...I worked for over 2 hours trying to get a new content pane from a menu item...nothing to commit... :-(

**Thoughts**: I really suck at action listeners and Layout Managers; I mean - really suck...I may get a book just about Java Swing components.

### Day 10: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a separate Class in the AleCulator program specifically to figure out Layout Managers...currently it is Card Layout which looks like what I am going to end up wanting/using...should have used it first. I was actually getting what I planned at the end.

**Thoughts**: I only did a little over an hour but it felt very productive. I'm getting things quicker now (or at least things are sinking in). I plan on trying to install and mess around with Spring and Maven this weekend. Apparently if you want to be a working Java programmer (that gets paid anyway) these tools are essential.

### Day 11: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added CardLayout to my main AleFrame Class. It definitely needs work but I got the separate panels to do what I intended...I have to hit the trigger to add the second panel twice, so something is up with my logic there...Spent WAY too long trying to 'install' Maven on my machine.

**Thoughts**: Maven is a bitch to install, but I need to figure it out. If I want to be a highly paid, professional Java programmer I apparently have to have Spring and Maven in my toolbox...

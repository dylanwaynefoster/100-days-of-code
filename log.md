# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a JFrame with constructor to play around with a nice UI.

**Thoughts:** I really suck at GitHub!!!

**Link to work:** I deleted the repository!!!

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to properly create a repository and push/pull to it from command line. I added BeerCalc...I will probably use bits and pieces of this and blend it with the UI...maybe make it a method with getters/setters.

**Thoughts**: Glad to get the GitHub problems somewhat under control...
